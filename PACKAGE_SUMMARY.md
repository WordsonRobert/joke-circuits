## 📋 What Each File Contains

### Main Files

**README.md** - Professional landing page featuring:
- Project overview with key findings
- Your actual generated jokes (the good ones!)
- Circuit structure summary
- Attention pattern discovery
- Model specs
- Getting started guide
- Clean, lowkey presentation (not overselling)

**LICENSE** - MIT License (open source, freely usable)

## 📝 What You Need To Do

### Step 1: Get Your Files from Google Drive

Download these from `/MyDrive/joke_mechanistic_interp/`:

**Images (→ results/ folder):**
- probe_evolution.png
- circuit_analysis.png
- attention_heads.png

**Notebooks (→ notebooks/ folder):**
- Your Colab notebooks as .ipynb files
- Rename to match:
  - 01_data_preparation.ipynb
  - 02_training.ipynb
  - 03_circuit_analysis.ipynb
  - 04_attention_heads.ipynb

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repo

1. Go to github.com/new
2. Name: `joke-circuits`
3. Public repository
4. **Don't initialize** (we have files already)

### Step 3: Upload

Follow SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md in the package

**Quick version:**
```bash
cd joke-circuits/
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Mechanistic interpretability of humor"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/joke-circuits.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Verify

Check on GitHub that:
- ✅ README displays with images
- ✅ All docs are readable
- ✅ Notebooks are present
- ✅ Results folder has images
